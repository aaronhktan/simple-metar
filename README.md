# Simple METAR

A simple and beautiful way to view METARs.

### What are METARs?
According to Google, a METAR "is an aviation routine weather report issued at hourly or half-hourly intervals. It is a description of the meteorological elements observed at an airport at a specific time". Basically, weather for pilots.

### OK, how do I use it?
Simple - find the ICAO code for the station that you want to check the METAR for, or just let the browser determine your location.
